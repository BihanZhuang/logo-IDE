## Estimation
It would probably take around 1 hours to implement. I would need to make two new command classes, change resource files, and make changes to turtle.

## Review
Finished in around 40 minutes, changed turtlepool in addition to what were mentioned. No, but on second try.

## Analysis
It was almost the same a I remember. One possible improvement would be to have more clear error messages about why the error was occurring. I think it would be a little hard to figure out where else to change in addition to making new command classes.
